    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChosenRight</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>ChosenRight ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>ChosenRight does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data with external servers or third parties.</strong> All data is stored locally on your device and never leaves your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following information locally on your device for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> Your display name and baby's last name (as entered by you)</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Gender preferences, name style preferences, and other app settings</li>
        <li><strong>App Activity:</strong> Your name swipes, scores, and shortlist entries</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Status:</strong> Information about in-app purchases (handled securely by Apple)</li>
        <li><strong>User Identifier:</strong> A local identifier from Sign in with Apple (stored securely on your device)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is stored using iOS's standard local storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and file system) and is only accessible on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Sign in with Apple</h2>
    <p>We use Sign in with Apple for authentication. This service is provided by Apple and is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy. We only receive and store a user identifier locally on your device to maintain your app session. We do not have access to your Apple ID, email address, or any other information from your Apple account.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not use any analytics services, advertising networks, or third-party SDKs that collect data. The app does not transmit any data to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>In-app purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Purchase status is stored locally on your device to enable purchased features.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties. All data remains on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all app data at any time by using the "Reset App" feature in the app's menu. This will permanently delete all locally stored data, including preferences, swipes, scores, and shortlists.</p>
    <p>You can also delete the app from your device, which will remove all associated data.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed for adults (parents/guardians) choosing baby names. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us immediately.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View your data within the app</li>
        <li>Delete your data using the "Reset App" feature</li>
        <li>Delete the app to remove all data from your device</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="contact">
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> [Your contact email address]</p>
    </div>
    
    <p style="margin-top: 40px; color: #7f8c8d; font-size: 0.9em;">
        This privacy policy is effective as of the date listed above and applies to the ChosenRight iOS application.
